Each virtual device needs its own static random address, and it must stay the
same across reboots so the SmartRow app and Peloton recognise the device they
paired with. Unless set in the configuration, the addresses are derived from the
dongle's own MAC: stable for one Pi, different between Pis, so two bridges in
range of each other do not collide.
